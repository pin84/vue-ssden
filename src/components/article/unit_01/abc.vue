  <p>[1] I know it might sound strange, but recently I’ve started thinking about what the places you arrange to meet say about you. Let me give you an example of what I mean. The other day, I arranged to meet a friend of mine outside the post office in Moss Side, a particularly rough area of Manchester. My friend was late—as usual. I had to wait for half an hour in the street, watching the police drive by and the rain come down. While I was there, two people asked me for money and a big guy came up to me and said, “What are you looking at?” I suddenly thought, “What am I doing here? This is a terrible place to meet!”</p>

    [2] When I was younger, I used to meet people at bus stops because I didn’t want my parents to see who I was going out with. I didn’t want to meet in a bar because if I was the first one there, I’d look lonely and the manager might ask me my age. Now that I’m older and don’t live with my parents, I don’t care if I have to sit in a café or somewhere like that by myself. I’d rather look a bit lonely than be outside, getting cold and wet.

    [3] The friend I met the other day is always worried about being left on her own in a bar, so I had to wait in the street. When she finally turned up, we had our typical opening conversation. “Jane, there you are. I was beginning to worry.” “Sorry. I’m late. The traffic was awful.” The excuse can vary, but it’s never, “I’m sorry, I’m completely hopeless. I was basically just wasting time window shopping because I wanted to make sure you were here first so that I didn’t have to wait around for you.” And then I said, “Oh, well, never mind. At least you’re here now.” “Have you been waiting long?” She asked. “No, only five minutes.” And off we went. I suppose I should have got angry, but I didn’t want to spoil the evening. I guess it’s a sign that I must be getting old.
